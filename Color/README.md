I purchased a kit from Color because I really liked their [public portal](https://data.color.com/) to browse variant information.

While the return of data was not automated, I was allowed to fill out a HIPPA authorization form for Protected Health Information (PHI), which included a box to check for "Raw Genetic Data."  Once I get that, I will upload it to my [Personal Genome Project page](https://my.pgp-hms.org/profile/hu832966).

I didn't previously realize that I had the F5 Leiden mutation (increased risk of blood clots, [rs6025](), chr: on hg19), but I could 

I should also be able to verify that with my HIPPA-released data (and then I will post an update).

Also, I actually did have [23andMe report](https://you.23andme.com/reports/ghr.vte/) indicating increased risk for "*Hereditary Thrombophila*", but I had to recognize the different name (even though it was a report for the exact same variant, and "*Factor V Leiden variant*" was mentioned in the 23andMe report).  Also, the "variant present" designation in Color made me think the predictive power may be higher than a typical risk association (more like a carrier status).  However, the 23andMe report better matches my previous expectation:

*General population*: 1 in 1,000 (1-year risk)

*One copy of Factor V Leiden variant*:	2 in 1,000 (1-year risk)

*Two copies of Factor V Leiden variant*:	15 in 1,000 (1-year risk)

For example, I have had major surgeries without having blot clots (assuming things like removal of wisdom teeth counts).


Some reports are also up there, but I also encounted some issues uploading PDF files recently.  So, I decided to go ahead and post all of that information here.

I also though the following notes from the ordering physican were interesting:

- **A possible drug-drug interaction was detected:** Some of the medications you shared you are taking (indomethacin and citalopram) may have an increased risk of an interaction. Please do not make any changes to your medications before speaking to your provider. The benefits of taking these interacting medications at the same time can often outweigh the risks and stopping a medication suddenly could be harmful. We recommend you speak with the healthcare provider who prescribed these medications to discuss if they are working as intended.
- **Your other medications may affect how your body processes medications:** Some of the medications you shared you are taking (citalopram) may impact how your body processes medications. Taking these medications at the same time may lead to a different response to the medications than the genetic results suggest. Please do not make any changes to your medications before speaking to your provider. The benefits of taking these interacting medications at the same time can often outweigh the risks, and stopping a medication suddenly could be harmful. We recommend you speak with the healthcare provider who prescribed these medications to discuss if they are working as intended.

There was also the following general note (as of 6/27/2019) under "**Medications and your genetic results**": You may notice that there is no information about specific medications in your report. The FDA recently issued a safety communication about genetic tests that claim to predict patients’ responses to specific medications. In response to the FDA’s communication and out of an overabundance of caution, our reports and clinical pharmacists are not currently providing information about specific medications. We continue to explore ways to add information about medication in accordance with FDA guidance and will update you when any new information is added.

I'm not sure if these were manually entered.  However, if it is possible to learn more about the primary evidence for those notes (even though they don't involve any genetic information).

The "*Medication Response*" results also allow you to schedule an appointment with a clinical pharmacist at no additional cost.  So, I will also check that out and post some notes here.

The "*Medication Response*" portion also covers 14 genes, but 2 genes (CYP2C19 and CYP2D6) were provided at the same time as the other results whereas there was a total wait time of ~6 months for the other 12 genes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP4F2, DPYD, NUDT15 rs116855232, TPMT, F5 rs6025, IFNL3 rs12979860, SLCO1B1 rs4149056, and VKORC1 rs9923231).

I think the "*Medications and your genetic results*" note is the reason that I have Mental Health Medication Insights in the 2-gene report but not the 14-gene report.  However, if the "FDA exercises enforcement discretion" *FDA Category Designation* status in the [Genetic Testing Registry](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/tests/561719/performance-characteristics/) relates to the specific drug associations, then I am surprised that there hasn't been a more severe consequence for Myriad's GeneSight test that has [the same designation in the GTR](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gtr/tests/508961/performance-characteristics/).  For example, there was a [GenomeWeb article](https://www.genomeweb.com/regulatory-news/fda-tells-patients-docs-take-caution-when-using-unapproved-pgx-tests-make-treatment) in late 2018 mentioning the GeneSight did not have FDA approval.

I also thought I saw a warning that medication predictions can be less accurate if you take multiple medications, but I am having a hard time finding such a communciation from Color (so, perhaps I am remembering something incorrectly, or I possibly misread one of the bold notes above).
