I first tested a very simple strategy (looking for the presence of a variant or a reference match in at least one read, and defining the variant as heterozygous if it was present).  However, I couldn't do this for the Color lcWGS data (for the subset of 1000 Genomes variants that I was checking), and this showed a noticable loss in the relatedness estimates between my samples (producing kinship estimates of ~0.24, instead of a kinship estimate of ~0.50 between my 23and Me and Genes for Good SNP chips).

So, I thought I needed to instead see what I could accomplish with some imputation strategies.  Since the strategy above wasn't very good at defining a starting set of genotypes, I needed to find strategies that start with FASTQ or BAM input files (and/or provide an alternative way to start with a small set of more accurate genotypes, upstream of imputation).
