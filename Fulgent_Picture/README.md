### Timeline Information

I ordered a kit on 12/1/2023.

I activated my kit on 12/6/2023.  This was the delivery date for my kit.  I put the sample in the mail as soon as possible.

I recieved physican approval ("physican-mediated" - I did not meet this physican) on 12/9/2023.

Picture indicated that they recieved my sample on 12/11/2023.

I was notified that I could view my results on 12/28/2023.  I was also able to download a VCF File:

### Report Information

There was a large amount of information provided, and I am currently not sure what to think about all of the results.

For example, the results certainly cover more than the [*All of Us* "Medicine and DNA" Report](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/All_of_Us/Medicine_and_DNA%20-%20230408.pdf).  However, including more results may not necessarily be positive, if the results are not highly predictive (in my opinion).

However, I currently take *citalopram*, and the status for that drug was *"Standard Precaution"*.

I liked that I was immediately able to download a VCF file.  However, it was a small file that only contained 39 variants.
