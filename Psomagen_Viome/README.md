I ordered 2 kits from 2 companies (on 3/3/2021):

***Psomagen***: [Gene & GutBiome Combo](https://psomagen.com/gene-gutbiome-combo/) and [GutBiome+](https://psomagen.com/gutbiome/)

***Viome***: [Health Intelligence Test](https://www.viome.com/products/health-intelligence) and [Gut Intelligence Test](https://www.viome.com/products/gut-intelligence)

I very much hope that I can get raw data, but this does provide something that can be compared (even if I can't).

The 2 Psomagen kits arrived on 3/8/2021, and the 2 Viome kits arrived on 3/5/2021.

All 4 samples were collected and mailed on 3/11/2021.  Please note that you may need to use 2 different e-mail addresses in order to compare 2 samples at the same time from Viome.

I recieved my Psomagen *Gene & GutBiome* report on 3/31/2021.

## Other Notes

**1)** There is no liquid in the Psomagen stool collection tubes, so I don't believe there is anything to stop or reduce bacterial growth post-collection.

Post-collection bacterial growth includes things like the "[blooms](https://msystems.asm.org/content/3/3/e00031-18)" discussed in the American Gut project paper.

It looks like the blog post that caused me to design this experiement with newer metagenomics samples is [now private](https://twitter.com/UseqMiseq/status/466559572069453825).  However, I believe that also tested technical replicates submitted to multiple companies.

**2)** I did not realize it at the time of ordering, but one of the Viome kits (including Viome Health Intelligence) requires a **blood** sample.  To be fair, this is listed on the [description](https://www.viome.com/products/health-intelligence) for the product, if you scroll down or find the word "Collection Method"

To help me remember (and  perhaps make more clear to others) here is the content related to the blood collection:

"***Fasting: Viome requires fasting before collecting your Human Gene Expression™ (blood) sample.** The simplest way to do this is to collect your sample right after you wake, before eating any food or drinking anything other than water (Note—your kit instructions may not contain this step, please disregard and follow the directions here).*

*Watch our [step-by-step instruction video here](https://www.viome.com/stepstotest/health-intelligence/collect-hi) for the best techniques for easy collection.*

*We recommend **collecting both your blood and stool samples within the same day** (if this is too difficult for you, a few days in between samples will not impact your results).*"

My experiences with my [nutrigenomics](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/tree/master/Nutrigenomics) testing (which included some metabolite measurements) was that I don't think I prefer the at-home collection (if it can be avoided).  In fact, if you watch that video, you will see that you need ***4 Minivettes*** of blood (each of which appears to require multiple drops of blood, based upon 2:30 to 2:55 in the video).  For this reason, I only submitted the stool sample for my Health Intelligence Test (converting my kit type, without requiring blood collection).

I am not concerned about the extra costs for the part that I do not want to collect (the blood samples).  However, others might want to know that a partial refund is not possible (if they find themselves in a similar situation).  For me, this was only an extra $100 with the sale price.  However, I think the regular price difference is $300 (as of 3/10/2021).

**3)** It might also be worth noting that [Psomagen](https://psomagen.com/) provides other genomics services, but I believe the others are not Direct-To-Consumer.

**4)** I have not tried it myself, but I believe [thryve](https://www.thryveinside.com/products/thryves-gut-health-test) is another option for gut microbiome analysis.
