I ordered a kit on 2/28/2024.

I recieved the kit, collected my sample, and I returned the kit on 3/5/2024.

I recieved an e-mail notification that my sample was recieved on 3/15/2024.

I recieved a [report]() with results on 3/19/2024.

However, I believe that my DQ8-DQ8 status was defined by **1 SNP** (*[rs7454108](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs7454108)*), when I hoping to have evidence based upon the separate HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 gene sequences.
