To be fair, I am starting with a [negative bias](https://twitter.com/cwarden45/status/1134864619552378880).  However, I will be very happy if I can convience people that the companies / organizations need to *i)* share your raw data with you, *ii)* share all the details for coming to their conclusions, and *iii)* have some way of publically sharing trends in their own data, with fair representations in limitations in confidence.  

In other words, that is a little different than the results being inaccurate, which is harder to show (and I have to be mindful of my prior expectations, since that can cause me to be overly harsh).

EverlyWell:
-----------------

There were 3 "Genomics Tests" tests on the EverlyWell website.  I ordered two of them (the **Food Sensitivity Test+** and **Metabolism Test+**).

While I will describe the results when I get them, I did want to mention one thing before I forget:

The "*Food Sensitivity*" test is a blood test (testing for **IgG reactivity**).  While I was initially confused because I had a saliva collection tube for the "*Metabolism Test*" but not the "Food Sensitivity" test (and that saliva collection tube was *not* an OrageneDx spit kit - it was just had a generic conical tube with some barcode stickers on it), **I think this is because I already have my Exome sequenced from Helix** (and the saliva collection kit for the Metabolism Test is being used for something other than DNA sequencing).

For example, what I recieved does match the [EverlyWell Food Sensitivity Test](https://www.everlywell.com/products/food-sensitivity/).  I'm still a little confused about [a product picture](https://dxkmbl8uwuv9p.cloudfront.net/myhelix/1556831649426/562cb0c0-de4d-43d8-944b-98ebbf3adf78/FS_WhatYoullGet_Img.png) on the Helix website (which actually matches what I saw, without a "Saliva Collection Tube" in the listing of kit materials).  However, I was initially sufficiently concerned that I posted a reply to the Twitter discussion thread.  **Accordingly, I promptly deleted that as soon as I saw this alternative explanation.**  While this still leaves me some concerns, they are not as urgent as I intially thought.  ***So, I apologize if anybody saw that response in the brief time that it was posted.***

Also, as a matter of personal preference, I like getting my blood drawn by somebody else (you can't look away when you are using a lancet on yourself).  However, that may just be me :)

Uploaded 23andMe data at same time as AncestryDNA data.

"SNP not detected" doesn't explain all differences:
