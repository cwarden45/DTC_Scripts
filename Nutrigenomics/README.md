To be fair, I am starting with a [negative bias](https://twitter.com/cwarden45/status/1134864619552378880).  However, I will be very happy if I can convince people that the companies / organizations need to *i)* share your raw data with you, *ii)* share all the details for coming to their conclusions, and *iii)* have some way of publically sharing trends in their own data, with fair representations in limitations in confidence.  

In other words, that is a little different than the results being inaccurate, which is harder to show (and I have to be mindful of my prior expectations, since that can cause me to be overly harsh).

EverlyWell (Helix for DNA Sequencing):
-----------------

There were 3 "Genomics Tests" tests on the EverlyWell website.  I ordered two of them (the **Food Sensitivity Test+** and **Metabolism Test+**).

One thing that I thought was interesting was that EverlyWell provides a way to share a hyperlink for your results:

**Food Sensitivity Test+**: https://my.everlywell.com/share/bb7b19955a388aa6292a8236

**Metabolism Test+**: https://my.everlywell.com/share/d0290a346aa6994e4fb5ad4e

The individual PDF that you can download contains both the blood test and the DNA test data for the **Metabolism+ Test**, but only the blood results for the **Food Sensitivity Test+** (so, I uploaded a PDF with screenshots for DNA part, even though the above link is probably preferable).

I also uploaded the Doctor versions.  At least for the *Food Sensitivity* test, I think the patient version is better: I only had "Mild" and "Low" reactivity (no "Moderate" or "High" results).  With the possible exception of a "Mild" reactivity to cow milk, none of the reactivity was severe enough to impact my diet.  In other words, I think the doctor would probably get unnecessary alarm if they only saw an "ABNORMAL" result.

For the DNA part, I don't think this is the best way to survey your genome.  If a group has some markers that they think are intesting, some *free* interpretation of your genotypes (perhaps offered from a non-profit) seems more appropriate than charging to cover 4-5 SNPs (particularly, if they also would have used Exome+, and would have [charged extra](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/tree/master/Helix_Mayo_GeneGuide) to get access to your full raw data).  However, they do provided the rsID for [dbSNP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/), which is good.

Also, for the DNA *Food Sensitivity Test+*, most of the markers are risk associations for metabolites commonly checked in blood tests for a routine check-up (which I would imagine would be free to most people with insurance).  So, if I were a doctor, I would never prescribe the DNA part (I would just check your metabolites).  It also seems concievable to me that people may more frequently have free genome sequences with programs like [All of US](https://allofus.nih.gov/).

The blood *Metabolism test* measured 3 metabolites, so I entered them into my [Patients Like Me](https://www.patientslikeme.com/members/818028) profile.  I had been previously tested for TSH, so I could compare these measurements with an earlier test that was covered through insurance.  I'm not sure how much it matters (and it is probably about time for my next check-up), but the EverlyWell TSH level was a little higher than 2 of my previous measurements:

![PatientsLikeMe TSH](PatientsLikeMe_TSH.PNG "PatientsLikeMe TSH")

Because I already had Helix Exome+ data, the cost for these tests was a little lower than me.  However, the Metabolism Test then cost *$149.99* and the Food Sensitivity then cost *$209.99*.  So, if these are things that you can get through your insurance, that may be worth considering.

Also, before I got my results, I had some notes that I recorded before I forgot:

The "*Food Sensitivity*" test is a blood test (testing for **IgG reactivity**).  While I was initially confused because I had a saliva collection tube for the "*Metabolism Test*" but not the "Food Sensitivity" test (and that saliva collection tube was *not* an OrageneDx spit kit - it was just had a generic conical tube with some barcode stickers on it), **I think this is because I already have my Exome sequenced from Helix**.

Also, the saliva collection kit for the Metabolism Test is being used for something other than DNA sequencing?  To be clear, I'm not saying that the generic conical tube is bad.  However, I am saying the work needs to be done at the appropriate pace, so that I have reasonable expectations of what I will recieve.  If I see one thing on-line and I get something else delivered, that causes me some amount of concern. 

For example, what I recieved does match the [EverlyWell Food Sensitivity Test](https://www.everlywell.com/products/food-sensitivity/).  I'm still a little confused about [a product picture](https://dxkmbl8uwuv9p.cloudfront.net/myhelix/1556831649426/562cb0c0-de4d-43d8-944b-98ebbf3adf78/FS_WhatYoullGet_Img.png) on the Helix website (which actually matches what I saw, without a "Saliva Collection Tube" in the listing of kit materials).  However, I was initially sufficiently concerned that I posted a reply to the Twitter discussion thread.  Accordingly, I promptly deleted that as soon as I saw this alternative explanation.  While this still leaves me some concerns, they are not as urgent as I intially thought.  *So, I apologize if anybody saw that response in the brief time that it was posted.*

Also, as a matter of personal preference, I like getting my blood drawn by somebody else (you can't look away when you are using a lancet on yourself, and I got light-headed the one / first time that I donated a large amount of blood).  However, I realize that people with diabetes unfortunately have to do something similar every day (although I thought the volume of blood was less: I have to wait to produce enough blood for 5 large spots for each of these tests).  Nevertheless, this may be less of an issue for other people.

Also, I think the other parts of the test are being done by more specialized laboratories.  For example, I mailed my *Food Sensitivity* test to ***Alletess Medicial Laboratory***, and I mailed my *Metabolism* test to ***Ayumetrix LLC***.  I support having a centralized system to find more specialized labs / information.  However, if the analysis is really being done by different entities, I think that should be made more clear (if they deserve a non-trivial amount of credit / responsiblity).

Orig3n:
-----------------

As I note in the original Twitter discussion that I referenced, I purchased two kits that used swabs (**Metabolism** and **Hunger & Weight**).

"**Hunger & Weight**" provides genotypes for 7 SNPs / genes (for $49).  Citations are provided, but genomic position / rsID not shown in web-interface.

Vitagene:
-----------------
Just so that I don't forget, I am noting a swab (instead of a spit-kit) was used for DNA collection (so, Orig3n isn't the only one to do this, although Vitagene used two swabs for one kit, both of which were stored in solution to be mailed).

Raw data was provide to download (comma-separate text file with genotypes).

GenoPalate:
-----------------

Uploaded 23andMe data at same time as AncestryDNA data.
