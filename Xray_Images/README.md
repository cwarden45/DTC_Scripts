**Radiologist Notes:**

*Findings:* There is slight straightening of the lordotic curvature lumbar spine. There is also slight narrowing of the L5-S1 disc space. There is no compression fracture identified. The pedicles and spinous processes and SI joints are unremarkable.

*Impression:* Mild muscle spasm with straightening of the lordotic curve. Mild degenerative disc disease at the L4-5 and L5-S1 level.

**Radiologist Notes:**

*Findings:* There is normal lumbar lordosis. No significant listhesis. Vertebral body heights are maintained. Disc spaces are preserved. No significant facet hypertrophy. Nonobstructive bowel gas pattern.

*Impression:* No acute findings.

**Blood (platelet) donation experiences:**

While at least somewhat off-topic, I referenced the X-rays posted in this location within an FDA MedWatch report that I don't believe was successfully completed.

However, I believe that I have worked with the blood donation staff to determine a solution.  So, if that might be helpful for others, then I wanted to at least share that in this location (even if the FDA MedWatch re-submission might still not be successful).

*Earlier Platelet Donation:* I encountered moderate, acute adverse events for ~2 weeks following a platelet donation.  In terms of symptoms: 1) there were some nights where the pain in my back woke me up, 2) there were some mornings when it was difficult to get out of bed (where I needed to only move some part of my body and wait before fully standing up out of bed), 3) I believe that I can say I look my 10 mg cyclobenzaprine more often than average, and 4) pain/discomfort varies by day but I believe the average per week was higher after the platelet donation than after the platelet donation.****

*More Recent Platelet Donation:*  I was able to reduce/avoid side effects and adverse events.

**I believe that relates to the following strategies:**

**1)** I provided a **single large donation*, instead of a double donation.  *This was recommended to me during the donation.*

**2)** I look the maximum number of calcium supplements (n=6).  I will ask for this in advance next time.

**3)** I brought extra back supports (padding for the back, as well as a support that wrapped around my waist.  To some extent, I believe the extra back support might have helped.  *Either way, this is the connection to the x-rays to my lower back.*

After following those procedures, I was able to **avoid** the adverse reactions occuring within ~2 weeks of my earlier platelet donation.  Additionally, I believe that I also had *fewer symptoms during the donation*, such as less noticeable discomfort in my jaw.
