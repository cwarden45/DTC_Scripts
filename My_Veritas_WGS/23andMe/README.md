Please see this [blog post](http://cdwscience.blogspot.com/2012/06/my-23andme-results-getting-free-second.html) to learn more about the Perl scripts

**Perl Script Notes**
- hg19 is no longer the latest reference sequence, but it is what was used for my WGS sample and you can get hg19 annotationsfrom SeattleSeq here: http://snp.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSeqAnnotation138/
- SeattleSNP didn't recognize some alleles from 23andMe (mostly deletions)

**New Scripts**
- **23andMe_to_VCF.py** - converts 23andMe raw format to VCF (`python 23andMe_to_VCF.py --input=[23andMe file]`, if you've run the Vertias WGS scripts.  Type `python 23andMe_to_VCF.py --help` for more information)
