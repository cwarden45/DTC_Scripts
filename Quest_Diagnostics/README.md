## Genetic Insights

I ordered a kit on 11/8/2023.  I recieved physican approval ("physican-mediated" - I did not meet this physican), with a name listed in the Quest order details.

My kit was activated on 11/15/2023.

Quest indicated that they recieved my sample on 11/22/2023.

After a noticable amount of time, I noticed that my sample was reported to not yet be at the DNA extraction stage.  So, on 1/7/2024, I sent a message to Quest about my sample's progress.

If electronic communication isn't successful for this test (QST-00332874), then I am not sure if I might need to use the contact information provied within the Quest Health interface: 1-866-697-8378 (M-F, 8am-7pm EST)
