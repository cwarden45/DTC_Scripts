## Genetic Insights

I ordered a kit on 11/8/2023.  I recieved physician approval ("physician-mediated" - I did not meet this physican), with a name listed in the Quest order details.

My kit was activated on 11/15/2023.

Quest indicated that they recieved my sample on 11/22/2023.

After a noticable amount of time, I noticed that my sample was reported to not yet be at the DNA extraction stage.  So, on 1/7/2024, I sent a message to Quest about my sample's progress.

I somehow didn't notice the voicemail as soon as it arrived, but I was informed to call a phone number that I don't believe I saw listed among the information on 1/8/2024.  I called the phone number on 1/15/2024, and I was informed that there is a common delay and results are expected in **Spring 2024**.  I believe that I was also offered a partial refund, but I did not accept the refund.  I was mostly confused because it appeared that the DNA from my sample in November was still not extracted.  I will wait for addtional e-mail updates.

On 2/14/2024, I recieved an update that "the results of your Genetic Insights test will be delayed".  Due to the "major inconvenience", my understanding is that there should be a refund credited by 3/15/2024 (and, I hope, results will be returned as well).  I was offered 40% off another test.  However, I checked the other available tests to order, and I did not see another test that I wanted to order.  However, hopefully, free results will be returned before too much longer.
