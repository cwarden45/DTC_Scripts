My Biosample collection was on **2/21/2019**

I am not exactly sure when my sample was sequenced, but I recieved a notification that I could recieve my ancestry and trait results on 3/26/2021.  I recieved a notification that I could view my "Medicine and Your DNA" and "Hereditary Disease Risk" results on 4/7/2023.

If you are not already aware of the program for free genome sequencing, you can learn more about **All of Us** [here](https://allofus.nih.gov/).

## Ancestry

I very much like that the emphasis in on the broad continential assignments.

I believe that the 100% European result matches my [Genes for Good](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Genes_for_Good/GFG_Report.pdf) result.

Strictly speaking, I believe I really do have some African ancestry (or at least something a little different than the rest of my European ancestry).  However, if there is at least some voice about the limitations to the ancestry, then I think that is a good start.  If it helps, you can see more detailed information about what I am trying to say in [this blog post](http://cdwscience.blogspot.com/2019/08/genome-wide-broad-level-super.html).

Also, I believe this is the same as [my separately ordered Color results](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Color/Ancestry.PNG).  In terms of the broad ancestry, this is OK.  However, that is based upon low coverage sequecning data, which I have other concerns about.  So, I hope some of the other parts of the Color reports are not used (and I have other notes [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/tree/master/Color)).

If raw data was not provided, then I would say that is a problem.  However, my understanding is that a portal to download your raw data is in development.

So, overall, given that these results were free, I think that this is good!

## Traits

In terms of predicting my traits:

**Bitter taste**: I don't like bitter things, but I can definitely taste them.  There are certain types of brocolli that I find bitter.  However, for the brocolli and brussel sprouts that you usually find at the store, I don't think they are too bitter. (so, *may or may not* match report?)

I was simply not reading my 23andMe report close enough, but I didn't realize this specifically related to the presence of phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) in the food.  I don't currently see the full name of the chemical in the 23andMe report, but both 23andMe and All of Us report my [rs713598](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs713598) genotype as C/C.  For example, one of the sentences mentioning "PTC" in the 23andMe report is "*PTC isn't usually found in the human diet, but it is similar to chemicals present in vegetables like broccoli and brussels sprouts*."

**Cilantro preference**: I don't a strong cilantro preference, good or bad (so, does *not* match report, ***but*** report says that this association is not very predictive - almost like this is not supposed to match for a lot of people?)

**Earwax type**: I think my earwax is fairly wet (**does** match report)

**Lactose intolerance**: As an adult, I would say I have mild lactose intolerance (does *not* match report), and that is why I drink almond milk instead of dairy milk at home.  However, it is not so bad that I cut out dairy products altogether.

I think it is worth keeping in mind that this is free.  So, even though everything doesn't match, and I did learn some things.  I am also guessing that there will be future reports.

I think it might help if there was more of a sense of confidence in the results communicated.  My preference would be to focus on what is most clear, but some negative results can also be informative (particularly if it might clear up a common misconception).

In terms of predictive limitations, I am glad that the subtitle for the cilantro report is "***Your DNA isn’t the key to cilantro preference***."  I wish this was even more clear, but I think this is the right idea.

## Medicine (Pharmacogenomics)

I **expanded** the details when creating the PDF, which includes **more details of what was tested** and **limitations in the results**.

## Hereditary Disease

**Result**: *"We did not find anything significant for your health in the genes we looked at."*

I **expanded** the details when creating the PDF, in order to see the **list of genes** tested and **limitations in the results**.
