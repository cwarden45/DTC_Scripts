I will see if I can look up the more exact date for Biosample collection.  However, I think the 1st agreement that I see is from 1/26/2019.

I am not exactly sure when my sample was sequenced, but I recieved a notification that I could recieve my ancestry and trait results on 3/26/2021

## Ancestry

I very much like that the emphasis in on the broad continential assignments.

I believe that the 100% European result matches my [Genes for Good](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Genes_for_Good/GFG_Report.pdf) result.

Strictly speaking, I believe I really do have some African ancestry (or at least something a little different than the rest of my European ancestry).  However, if there is at least some voice about the limitations to the ancestry, then I think that is a good start.

Also, given that these results were free, I think that this is excellent!

## Traits

In terms of predicting my traits:

**Bitter taste**: I don't like bitter things, but I can definitely taste them.  There are certain types of brocolli that I find bitter.  However, for the brocolli and brussel sprouts that you usually find at the store, I don't think they are too bitter. (so, *may or may not* match report?)

I was simply not reading my 23andMe report close enough, but I didn't realize this specifically related to the presence of phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) in the food.  I don't currently see the full name, but both 23andMe and All of Us report my [rs713598](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs713598) genotype as C/C.  For example, one of the sentences mentioning "PTC" in the 23andMe report is "*PTC isn't usually found in the human diet, but it is similar to chemicals present in vegetables like broccoli and brussels sprouts. *".

**Cilantro preference**: I don't a strong cilantro report (so, does *not* match report, ***but*** report says that this association is not very predictive - almost like this is not supposed to match for a lot of people?)

**Earwax type**: I think my earwax is fairly wet (**does** match report)

**Lactose intolerance**: As an adult, I would say I have mild lactose intolerance (does *not* match report)

Because this is all free, I am not really complaining.

However, I was hoping that the focus was going to be different than 23andMe (if anything, helping emphasize what is really well known and predictive, and when there are limits to what you can predict from genomics).

For the later, I am glad that the subtitle for the cilantro report is "**Your DNA isn’t the key to cilantro preference.**"  I wish this was even more clear, but I think this is the right idea.
