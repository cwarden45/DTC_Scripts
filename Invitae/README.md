### Timeline Information

I ordered a kit on 12/4/2023.

I recieved physican approval ("physican-mediated" - I did not meet this physican) on 12/5/2023.

I believe my kit was delivered on 12/7/2023, which is indicated in my report as the sample collection date.  I put the sample in the mail as soon as possible.

Invitae indicated that they recieved my sample on 12/12/2023.

I was notified that I could view my results on 12/22/2023.  I also contacted the company about raw data on that date.

I am expecting to be able to recieve a BAM alignment file by contacting *clientservices@invitae.com*, based upon the FAQ question "*Can I download my genetic data?*".

### Report Information

The [report](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Invitae/report_RQ5937338.pdf) includes a positive result for the **F5** gene (for [ClinVar Accession 642](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/642)).

This result is **not** consistently reported from all companies/organizations.  For example, this result is **not** provided in my [*All of Us* Hereditary Disease report](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/All_of_Us/Hereditary%20Disease%20Risk%20-%20230408.pdf) from the NIH.

However, this variant ([rs6025](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs6025)) is listed in my [23andMe results](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/23andMe/23andMe--HealthPredispositionRisk--231222.pdf) as being at **"Slightly Increased Risk"** for *Hereditary Thrombophilia*.

This variant is also described in my [Sequencing.com](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Sequencing.com/Healthcare_Pro-211016.pdf) report.  However, I think I may prefer the description provided by 23andMe (and I prefer this Invitae summary over what is provided from Sequencing.com).
