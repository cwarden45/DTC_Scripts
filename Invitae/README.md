### Timeline Information

I ordered a kit on 12/4/2023.

I recieved physician approval ("physician-mediated" - I did not meet this physican) on 12/5/2023.

I believe my kit was delivered on 12/7/2023, which is indicated in my report as the sample collection date.  I put the sample in the mail as soon as possible.

Invitae indicated that they recieved my sample on 12/12/2023.

I was notified that I could view my results on 12/22/2023.  I also contacted the company about raw data on that date.

I am expecting to be able to recieve a BAM alignment file by contacting *clientservices@invitae.com*, based upon the FAQ question "*Can I download my genetic data?*".

I received a request for a DocuSign signature on 12/28/2023 (in order to recieve my raw data).

On 1/10/2024, I recieved an message from an e-mail address ending with *revspringinc.com* indicating that payment was due to Invitae.  Some content looked like it was from Invitae, so I sent an e-mail (including a screenshot from my earlier message that confirmed payment at the time of ordering) to *billing@invitae.com*, in order to check if should follow the link from that message.

The next day (1/11/2024), I recieved a paper bill form Inviate.  *The itemized charges (including some individual genes( interesting to see.*  However, the paper bill was for the *exact same amount* as in my confirmation e-mail (*$368*), and I confirmed that same amount was present on my credit card in December.  So, I hope the billing team can help confirm that this is an error.

### Report Information

The [report](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Invitae/report_RQ5937338.pdf) includes a positive result for the **F5** gene (for [ClinVar Accession 642](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/variation/642)).

This result is **not** consistently reported from all companies/organizations.  For example, this result is **not** provided in my [*All of Us* Hereditary Disease report](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/All_of_Us/Hereditary%20Disease%20Risk%20-%20230408.pdf) from the NIH.

However, this variant ([rs6025](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs6025)) is listed in [my *23andMe* results](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/23andMe/23andMe--HealthPredispositionRisk--231222.pdf) as being at ***"Slightly Increased Risk"*** for *Hereditary Thrombophilia*.

I believe this variant is also described in my [Sequencing.com](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Sequencing.com/Healthcare_Pro-211016.pdf) report.  However, I think I may prefer the description provided by *23andMe* (and I prefer this *Invitae* summary over what is provided from *Sequencing.com*).
