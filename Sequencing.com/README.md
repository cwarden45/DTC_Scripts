Temporary links were created upon request to download the FASTQ reads and BAM alignment.  Those were public links, but they expired within 48 hours (and are not currently valid).

## DNA Selfie Results

There is an [icon automatically generated for my sample](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Sequencing.com/DNA_Selfie-Profile-211016.PNG), but that does not match what is produced by the App.

The [picture from the App also doesn't look like me](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Sequencing.com/MyDNASelfie-Sequencing.com-2021Oct17.png), but it is somewhat closer in some ways.  The main issue is **my hair**: even if my hair was lighter as a child, I think **light brown** is a better fit than light blonde, and this was an option (along with black and red).

I think the shade can only be "light" or "dark" hair color (not "medium" or "regular").
