## DNA Selfie Results

There is an [icon automatically generated for my sample](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Sequencing.com/DNA_Selfie-Profile-211016.PNG), but that does not match what is produced by the App.

The [picture from the App also doesn't look like me](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Sequencing.com/MyDNASelfie-Sequencing.com-2021Oct17.png), but it is somewhat closer in some ways.  The main issue is **my hair**: even if my hair was lighter as a child, I think **light brown** is a better fit than light blonde, and this was an option (along with black and red).

I think the shade can only be "light" or "dark" hair color (not "medium" or "regular").

**Nevertheless, I believe some forensic papers were cited, and I would say this methodology should not be used to prove innocence or be consistent with guilt (or the identity of the victim).**

There is also a "**Santa and Me | Compare Your DNA to St. Nick**" under the "*Children*" category.  However, given the results above, I think that you should at least expect limitations in the "Santa" reference.  I therefore question if this provide a balanced educational tool that gives children a sense the current utility of genomics.  However, to be fair, I ran out of App uses this month, and I canceled the subscription.

Simiarly, I was going to check how much the results varied for my 23andMe data or my Genes for Good data.  However, "1 App" counts for 1 use.  I would need 3 Apps in order to run the same application on 3 samples for myself.

## Cannabis DNA Health Report

I am not sure if there are any legal problems with offering this (at least in some locations).

There are a lot of results, and I think many are not directly related to the specific recommendation being made.  So, I am not sureshould be the "truth" results.  However, I will continue to think about this.

My guess is that many of the results should be viewed critically, but I also thought this might help in giving others a sense of the of results that you can obtain (possibly with extra cost).

The run-time is longer than the other apps (3 days, versus less than 1 day).

I was going to check how much the results varied for my 23andMe data or my Genes for Good data.  However, "1 App" counts for 1 use.  I would need 3 Apps in order to run the same application on 3 samples for myself.

In general, one goal of all the postings is to help critically assess the results.  ***So, providing a report should not be considered an endorsement.***  In fact, if offering my opinion, I would probably **not** encourage purchasing any of the app results that I have downloaded.  For example, you can see a draft of what I submitted to FDA MedWatch [here](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Sequencing.com/Cannabis-DNA-Health-Report__FDA-MedWatch_draft.pdf).


However, at the same time, a lot of information is not directly related to cannabis, and I **don't** think everything should discredited because it is in the report (even if I think more information is needed to evaluate each specific claim, both in terms of the risk estimate as well the recommendation about action to take).  For example, I **am** a carrier for some increased risk for Alzheimer's Disease due to a variant in my APOE gene.  However, the variant details were not reported, and I was given what I believe is the strongest cateogry of "*Increased*" (when I know that I am much lower risk than somebody with 2 copies the vairant).  So, I don't believe this is the best way to learn that information.  Also, if you are a healthy individual, then my understanding is that your cannibis intake should usually not vary based upon your *risk* for most diseases (such as Alzheimer's).
