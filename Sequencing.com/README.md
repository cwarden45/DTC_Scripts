## DNA Selfie Results

There is an [icon automatically generated for my sample](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Sequencing.com/DNA_Selfie-Profile-211016.PNG), but that does not match what is produced by the App.

The [picture from the App also doesn't look like me](https://github.com/cwarden45/DTC_Scripts/blob/master/Sequencing.com/MyDNASelfie-Sequencing.com-2021Oct17.png), but it is somewhat closer in some ways.  The main issue is **my hair**: even if my hair was lighter as a child, I think **light brown** is a better fit than light blonde, and this was an option (along with black and red).

I think the shade can only be "light" or "dark" hair color (not "medium" or "regular").

**Nevertheless, I believe some forensic papers were cited, and I would say this methodology should not be used to prove innocence or be consistent with guilt (or the identity of the victim).**

There is also a "**Santa and Me | Compare Your DNA to St. Nick**" under the "*Children*" category.  However, given the results above, I think that you should at least expect limitations in the "Santa" reference.  I therefore question if this provide a balanced educational tool that gives children a sense the current utility of genomics.  However, to be fair, I ran out of App uses this month, and I canceled the subscription.

Simiarly, I was going to check how much the results varied for my 23andMe data or my Genes for Good data.  However, "1 App" counts for 1 use.  I would need 3 Apps in order to run the same application on 3 samples for myself.
