# Sample 1

Kit purchased on 10/9/2022

Kit arrived and sample was collected on 10/11/2022.

Sample was collected with a funnel / spit-kit, so nothing was used to collect cells around a particular part of the mouth (such as the gumline, teeth, cheek, etc.).

I recieved results on 10/27/2022.  I then sent a follow-up e-mail requesting raw FASTQ data.

I recieved a custom link to recieve FASTQ files on 11/8/2022.  I have also uploaded those reads, and they are available to download using the links below:
